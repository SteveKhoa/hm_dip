# Homemade Image Processing Library

*For personal purpose.*

I do this little project as a practice for my Image Processing study. This library is not practical nor efficient for any real-life usage. However, I hope this could be a dev log for myself and for anyone who are interested in Image Processing at Beginner's level.

Notes
---
ready.cpp is a 'ready to use' file, intended for quick testing and examples. This file already includes all necessary headers and could be used directly.

Bugs
---
The *rotation* operation produces a *weird* transformation, many pixels are lost during the transformation, result in a noisy image.
